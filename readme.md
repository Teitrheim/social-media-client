Versioning Inconsistency and Correction

During the development, there was an inconsistency in version numbering due to a series of major and minor updates that were not sequentially tagged. The versioning jumped from "1.1.0" to "1.0.1" and then to "1.0.2", followed by a reset to "0.0.1" and "0.0.2".

This issue has been addressed by setting the version to "1.2.0", representing the current state of the project after significant feature updates and minor patches. This correction aligns with the semantic versioning principles and ensures clarity and consistency in future updates.
