# Project Name: Workflow

## Description

This project is a comprehensive application that includes a front-end login form, logout functionality, CRUD operations, and a user profile page. It is designed to demonstrate robust front-end development skills along with effective quality assurance practices.

## Configuration

This project uses various tools to ensure code quality and consistency:

- **Prettier**: For code formatting.
- **ESLint**: To enforce code quality.
- **Husky & lint-staged**: For pre-commit hooks ensuring linting and formatting checks.

## Versioning Inconsistency and Correction

During the development, there was an inconsistency in version numbering due to a series of major and minor updates that were not sequentially tagged. The versioning jumped from "1.1.0" to "1.0.1" and then to "1.0.2", followed by a reset to "0.0.1" and "0.0.2".

This issue has been addressed by setting the version to "1.2.0", representing the current state of the project after significant feature updates and minor patches. This correction aligns with the semantic versioning principles and ensures clarity and consistency in future updates.
